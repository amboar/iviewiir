Before committing your should be able to answer yes to the following questions:

1. Does it compile with Clang and GCC?
        for BASECC in gcc clang; do FULLCC=$(which $BASECC); if [ -e "$FULLCC" ]; then make clean; CC="$FULLCC" make || break; fi; done

2. Does it compile with resume support?
        for BASECC in gcc clang; do FULLCC=$(which $BASECC); if [ -e "$FULLCC" ]; then make clean; CC="$FULLCC" CFLAGS="-DCONFIG_RESUME" make || break; fi; done

3. Does lib(flvii|iview) cross-compile to powerpc?
        Uncomment necessary parts of respective Makefiles. libflvii must be uncommented prior to libiview if building with -DCONFIG_RESUME

4. Does libiview pass all tests?
        (cd libiview && make clean && make check)

5. Does it introduce any new errors according to scan-build?
        (CFLAGS="-DCONFIG_RESUME" scan-build make \
                && cd libiview && scan-build make check)

6. Does iviewiir execute correctly for all flags and parameter types?

7. Is valgrind happy with your efforts (i.e. you haven't introduced new leaks)?
        (valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full -- ./iviewiir -a)
