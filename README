        Description:

iviewiir is an application for listing and downloading episodes from ABC's
iView platform. Plenty of these already exist, however the point of
differentiation for iviewiir is that the end goal is to create a homebrew Wii
application, hence the C implementation.

        Example Usage:

$ ./iviewiir --help
Usage: iviewiir [-ihs] [SID:PID]

        -a --all: List all items in all non-empty series.
        -i --items-list=SID: List episodes in a series. Requires a SID as a parameter. The first element on each output line is a SID:PID tuple
        -s --series-list: List the series available. The first element on each output line is the SID
        -h --help: Show this help

Without any parameters a SID:PID tuple should be supplied, which will download the associated video

$ ./iviewiir --series-list
2716511 : "Hope Springs Series 1"
3032922 : "New Tricks Series 6"
2752253 : "Rush TV Series 1"
...

$ ./iviewiir --items-list 2716511
2716511:472085 - Hope Springs Series 1 Episode 6
2716511:472087 - Hope Springs Series 1 Episode 7

$ ./iviewiir 2716511:472085 # downloads "Hope Springs Series 1 Episode 6"

        Thanks:

iviewiir owes most of its design and implementation to the python-iview[1]
project. The abstractions aren't followed completely but a lot of the
implementation ideas were borrowed from there. Many thanks to Jeremy Visser!
